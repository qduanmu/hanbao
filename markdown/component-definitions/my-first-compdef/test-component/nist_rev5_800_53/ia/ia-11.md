# ia-11 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Re-authentication

## Control Statement

Require users to re-authenticate when {{ insert: param, ia-11_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

users are required to re-authenticate when {{ insert: param, ia-11_odp }}.

## Control guidance

In addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with device locks, organizations may require re-authentication of individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators or credentials change, when security categories of systems change, when the execution of privileged functions occurs, after a fixed time period, or periodically.
